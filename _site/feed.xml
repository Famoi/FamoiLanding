        <title>Knuth the beginning...</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I decided to push my knowledge of web development into a more computer science related paradigm. Yes I’ve never been the greatest lover of maths. Yet in the last year I’ve found a purpose and love for it that one had never thought I’d find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has started as a journey of learning pure maths through graph theory to stretching myself to touch discrete maths and calculus and then this week Lambada calculus. Yes really I’m getting pretty serious about this. It seems to be helping my problem solving skills extensively. Whilst having also pushed me onto the biggest project that one has ever started in the Financial Technology (FinTech) segement of the market.&lt;/p&gt;
